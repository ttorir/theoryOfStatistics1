### Environment
All packages needed are included in `requirements.txt`

### Running + Replication
To regenerate figures included in the paper: `figure_generation.ipynb`<br>
To revisit the parameter selection for model selection: `data_generation.ipynb`<br>
To regenerate the raw data in the paper: `model_generation.py`<br>
To regenerate the rendered heatmaps + latex for the tables: `model_analysis.ipynb`<br>
